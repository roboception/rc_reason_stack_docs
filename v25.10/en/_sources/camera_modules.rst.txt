3D modules

The

rc_reason_stack

's 3D camera software consists of the following modules:

Stereo matching module (rc_stereomatching, Section
\ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching})  uses the rectified stereo
image pairs of the connected stereo camera, e.g. the rc_visard, to
compute 3D depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence
images. This module only runs on pipeline types for stereo cameras,
i.e. rc_visard, rc_viscore and stereo_ace.

Zivid module (rc_zivid, Section \ref{zivid:sect-zivid})  provides 3D
depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images of
the connected zivid structured light camera. This module only runs on
pipelines of type zivid.

Orbbec module (rc_orbbec, Section \ref{orbbec:sect-orbbec})  provides
3D depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images
of the connected Orbbec Gemini 335Le stereo camera. This module only
runs on pipelines of type orbbec.

These modules are pipeline specific, which means that they run inside
each camera pipeline. Changes to their settings or parameters only
affect the corresponding pipeline and have no influence on the other
camera pipelines running on the

rc_reason_stack

.
