Creating and restoring backups of settings

The

rc_reason_stack

 offers the possibility to download the current settings as backup or
for transferring them to a different

rc_visard

 or

rc_cube

.

The current settings of the

rc_reason_stack

 can be downloaded on the

Web GUI

's

System

 page in the

rc_reason_stack


Settings

 section. They can also be downloaded via the

rc_reason_stack

's

REST-API interface

 using the

GET /system/backup

 request.

For downloading a backup, the user can choose which settings to
include:

nodes: the settings of all modules (parameters, preferred orientations
and sorting strategies)

load_carriers: the configured load carriers

regions_of_interest: the configured 2D and 3D regions of interest

grippers: the configured grippers (without the CAD elements)

The returned backup should be stored as a .json file.

The templates of the SilhouetteMatch and CADMatch modules are not
included in the backup but can be downloaded manually using the REST-
API or the Web GUI (see

Template API

 and

Template API

).

A backup can be restored to the

rc_reason_stack

 on the

Web GUI

's

System

 page in the

rc_reason_stack


Settings

 section by uploading the backup .json file. In the

Web GUI

 the settings included in the backup are shown and can be chosen for
restore. The corresponding

REST-API interface

 call is

POST /system/backup

.

Warning: When restoring load carriers, all existing load carriers on
  the

  rc_reason_stack

   will get lost and will be replaced by the content of the backup.
  The same applies to restoring grippers and regions of interest.

When restoring a backup, only the settings which are applicable to the

rc_reason_stack

 are restored. Parameters for modules that do not exist on the device
or do not have a valid license will be skipped. If a backup can only
be restored partially, the user will be notified by warnings.

Updating the software license

Licenses can be purchased from Roboception for enabling additional
features.

Downloading log files

During operation, the

rc_reason_stack

 logs important information, warnings, and errors into files. If the

rc_reason_stack

 exhibits unexpected or erroneous behavior, the log files can be used
to trace its origin. Log messages can be viewed and filtered using the

Web GUI

's  System ‣ Logs page. If contacting the support (

Contact

), the log files are very useful for tracking possible problems. To
download them as a .tar.gz file, click on Download all logs on the Web
GUI's System ‣ Logs page.

Aside from the Web GUI, the logs are also accessible via the

rc_reason_stack

's

REST-API interface

 using the

GET /logs

 and

GET /logs/{log}

 requests.
