Software modules

The

rc_reason_stack

 comes with several software modules, each of which corresponds to a
certain functionality and can be interfaced via its respective

node

 in the

REST-API interface

 or in the

Generic Robot Interface

.

The

rc_reason_stack

 offers the possibility to connect multiple 3D cameras such as the

rc_visard

. The image data from each device is processed in a separate

camera pipeline

, which consists of several different software modules. The modules
inside each pipeline are pipeline specific, which means that they can
have different parameters for each pipeline. The modules running
outside the pipelines are global and provide data for all modules in
all pipelines. An overview is given in

Fig. 7

. The port numbers are given for the default installation as described
in

Installation

 and may be changed in the docker compose file.


The

rc_reason_stack

's pipeline-specific software modules can be divided into

Camera module\:(Section \ref{camera:sect-camera})  acquires images and
performs planar rectification for using the camera as a measurement
device. Depending on the chosen camera pipeline type, this module
offers different run-time parameters.

3D modules\:(Section \ref{camera_modules:sect-3d-camera-modules})
which provide 3D depth information such as disparity, error, and
confidence images,

Detection & Measure modules\:(Section \ref{detection_modules:sect-
detection-modules})  which provide a variety of detection
functionalities, such as grasp point computation and object detection,

Configuration modules\:(Section \ref{configuration_modules:sect-
configuration-modules})  which enable the user to perform calibrations
and configure the rc_reason_stack for specific applications.

The modules that are global for all camera pipelines running on the

rc_reason_stack

 are the

Database modules\:(Section \ref{database_modules:sect-database-
modules})  which enable the user to configure global data available to
all other modules, such as load carriers, regions of interest and
grippers.
