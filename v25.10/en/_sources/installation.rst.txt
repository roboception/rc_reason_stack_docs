Installation

Warning: The instructions on

  Safety

   related to the

  rc_reason_stack

   must be read and understood prior to installation.

Software license

The functionality of the

rc_reason_stack

 can be enhanced anytime by

upgrading the license

, e.g., for optionally available software modules.

Note: The

  rc_reason_stack

   requires to be rebooted whenever the installed licenses have
  changed.

Power up

Discovery of rc_reason_stack devices

Roboception

rc_reason_stack

 devices that are powered up and connected to the local network or
directly to a computer can be found using the standard GigE Vision®
discovery mechanism.

Roboception offers the open-source tool "rcdiscover-gui", which can be
downloaded free of charge from

https://github.com/roboception/rcdiscover/releases

 for Windows and Linux. The tool's Windows version consists of a
single executable for Windows 7, 10 and 11, which can be executed
without installation. For Linux an installation package is available
for Ubuntu.

At startup, all available GigE Vision® devices -- including

rc_reason_stack

 devices -- are listed with their names, serial numbers, current IP
addresses, and unique MAC addresses. The discovery tool finds all
devices reachable by global broadcasts. Misconfigured devices that are
located in different subnets than the application host may also be
listed. A tickmark in the discovery tool indicates whether devices are
actually reachable via a web browser.


After successful discovery, a double click on the device row opens the

Web GUI

 of the device in the operating system's default web browser. Google
Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are recommended as web browser.

Resetting configuration

Network configuration

The

rc_reason_stack

 requires an Internet Protocol (

IP

) address for communication with other network devices. The IP address
must be unique in the local network, and can be set either manually
via a user-configurable persistent IP address, or automatically via

DHCP

. If none of these IP configuration methods apply, the

rc_reason_stack

 falls back to a

Link-Local

 IP address.

Following the

GigE Vision

® standard, the priority of IP configuration methods on the

rc_reason_stack

 is

   Persistent IP (if enabled)

   DHCP (if enabled)

   Link-Local


Options for changing the

rc_reason_stack

's network settings and IP configuration are:

   the System ‣ Network page of the rc_reason_stack's Web GUI -- if it
   is reachable in the local network already, see Web GUI\:(Section
   \ref{webgui:sect-web-gui})

   any configuration tool compatible with GigE Vision® 2.0, or
   Roboception's command-line tool gc_config. Typically, these tools
   scan for all available GigE Vision® devices on the network. All
   rc_reason_stack devices can be uniquely identified by their serial
   number and MAC address, which are both printed on the device.

   temporarily changing or completely resetting the rc_reason_stack's
   network configuration via Roboception's rcdiscover-gui tool, see
   Discovery of rc_reason_stack devices\:(Section \ref{installation
   :sect-discovery-of-rcvisard-devices})

Note: The command-line tool "gc_config" is part of Roboception's
  open- source convenience layer "rc_genicam_api", which can be
  downloaded free of charge for Windows and Linux from

  http://www.roboception.com/download

  .

Host name

Automatic configuration (factory default)

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (

DHCP

) is preferred for setting an IP address. If DHCP is active on the

rc_reason_stack

, which is the factory default, the device tries to contact a DHCP
server at startup and every time the network cable is being plugged
in. If a DHCP server is available on the network, the IP address is
automatically configured.

In some networks, the DHCP server is configured so that it only
accepts known devices. In this case, the Media Access Control address
(

MAC address

), which is printed on the device label, needs to be configured in the
DHCP server. At the same time, the

rc_reason_stack

's host name can also be set in the Domain Name Server (

DNS

). Both MAC address and host name should be sent to the network
administrator for configuration.

If the

rc_reason_stack

 cannot contact a DHCP server within about 15 seconds after startup,
or after plugging in the network cable, it assigns itself a unique IP
address. This process is called

Link-Local

. This option is especially useful for connecting the

rc_reason_stack

 directly to a computer. The computer must be configured for Link-
Local as well. Link-Local might already be configured as a standard
fallback option, as it is under Windows 10. Other operating systems
such as Linux require Link-Local to be explicitly configured in their
network managers.

Manual configuration

Specifying a persistent, i.e. static IP address manually might be
useful in some cases. This address is stored on the

rc_reason_stack

 to be used on device startup or network reconnection. Please make
sure the selected IP address, subnet mask and gateway will not cause
any conflicts on the network.

Warning: The IP address must be unique within the local network and
  within the local network's range of valid addresses. Furthermore,
  the subnet mask must match the local network; otherwise, the

  rc_reason_stack

   may become inaccessible. This can be avoided by using automatic
  configuration as explained in

  Automatic configuration (factory default)

  .

If this IP address cannot be assigned, e.g. because it is already used
by another device in the network, IP configuration will fall back to
automatic configuration via

DHCP

 (if enabled) or a

Link-Local

 address.
