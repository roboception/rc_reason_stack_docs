Overview

The

rc_reason_stack

 is a high-performance 3D-image-processing Docker software stack for
deployment on Ubuntu machines. It enhances the computing capabilities
of the Roboception stereo camera

rc_visard

 and supports the

rc_viscore

, the Basler

Stereo ace

 camera, the

Orbbec

 camera and the

zivid

 camera.

The

rc_reason_stack

 provides real-time camera images and depth images, which can be used
to compute 3D point clouds. Additionally, it provides confidence and
error images as quality measures for each image acquisition. It offers
an intuitive web UI (user interface) and standardized interfaces,
making it compatible with all major image processing libraries.

With optionally available software modules the

rc_reason_stack

 provides out-of-the-box solutions for object detection and robotic
pick-and-place applications.
