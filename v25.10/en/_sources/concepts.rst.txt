Measurement principles

The

rc_reason_stack

 is a high-performance 3D-image-processing software stack that is used
in combination with one or more 3D cameras such as Roboception's 3D
camera

rc_visard

 or

rc_viscore

. Together, they provide rectified camera, disparity, confidence, and
error images, which allow the viewed scene's depth values along with
their uncertainties to be computed.

In the following, the underlying measurement principles are explained
in more detail.
